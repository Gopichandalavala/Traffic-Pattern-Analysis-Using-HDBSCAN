Traffic Pattern Insights — HDBSCAN Clustering (Vijayawada)

Total Clusters Detected:
The clustering algorithm automatically grouped locations based on similarity in traffic behavior.
Clusters represent regions that follow the same trend in speed, vehicle density and time of day.

Peak Congestion Time:
Most traffic buildup occurs during 8 AM – 10 AM and 5 PM – 7 PM
This corresponds to office/commute peak hours.

Road Type Impact:
Main Roads and Service Roads show higher congestion levels.
Highways show comparatively smooth traffic flow.

Vehicle Type Impact:
Congestion score is highest when truck density is high.
Car and bike traffic also affect flow but to a lesser extent.

Noise Points:
A few scattered points are marked as noise – they do not belong to any cluster due to unusual / inconsistent traffic data.

Final Interpretation:
Cluster-based traffic analysis helps identify congestion hotspots without labeled data.
It can assist in city planning, signal timing control and smart transport system development.
